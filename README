The code here implements the basic idea described here:

ChRIS pipelines are directed acyclic graphs.
Scheduling of a ChRIS pipeline and validation of a ChRIS pipeline are two different problems.
Even so, these two problems share the same solution: breadth-first search.
If the graph is BFS-traversable where every node is visited exactly once,
it is implied the graph is a single connected component and a directed
acyclic graph. These are the graph property criteria for ChRIS pipeline validity.
